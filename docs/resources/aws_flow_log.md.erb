# aws\_flow\_low

Use the `aws_flow_log` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single Flow Log.

## Syntax

    describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Resource Parameteres
### flow_log_id

This resource expects a single parameter that uniquely identifies the Flow Log. You may pass it as a string, or as the value in a hash:

    describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_flow_log(flow_log_id: 'fl-8905f8e0') do
      it { should exist }
    end

### subnet_id

To search for a flow log by the associated subnet id:

    describe aws_flow_log(subnet_id: 'subnet-c6a4319c') do
      it { should exist }
    end

### vpc_id

To search for a flow log by the associated vpc id:

    describe aws_flow_log(vpc_id: 'vpc-96cabaef') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Matchers

For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### name

The `name` matcher tests the name of the flow log.

  describe aws_flow_log(subnet_id: 'subnet-c6a4319c') do
    its('name') { should cmp 'fl-9c718cf5' }
  end

### log_group_name

The `log_group_name` matcher tests the name of the associated log group.

  describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
    its('log_group_name') { should cmp 'test_log_group' }
  end

### resource_id

The `resource_id` matcher tests the id of the associated VPC, subnet, or network interface.
  describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
    its('resource_id') { should cmp 'subnet-c6a4319c' }
  end

### exist

Indicates that the Flow Log provided was found.  Use `should_not` to test for Flow Logs that should not exist.

    describe aws_flow_log('should-be-there') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_flow_log('should-not-be-there') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end
